title: Book route
---
# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the "Book route" feature.

The feature introduces a set of routes for managing books in the application.

We will cover:

1. Why we initialize the router.
2. Why we use authentication middleware.
3. How we handle different HTTP methods for book operations.

# Router initialization

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Book.js" line="6">

---

We start by initializing the router. This is necessary to define a modular, mountable route handler.

```
const router = express.Router();

```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Authentication middleware

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Book.js" line="8">

---

We apply authentication middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access the routes. This is done globally for all routes in this file.

```
router.use(auth.Auth)

```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Handling GET requests

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Book.js" line="10">

---

We define two GET routes. The first one retrieves all books, and the second one retrieves a specific book by its ID. Both routes require user authentication.

```
router.get('/', auth.user ,BookCtrl.GetAllBook);
router.get('/:id', auth.user, BookCtrl.GetOneBook);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Handling POST requests

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Book.js" line="12">

---

We define a POST route to create a new book. This route requires admin authentication to ensure that only administrators can add new books.

```
router.post('/', auth.admin,BookCtrl.CreateBook);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Handling PUT requests

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Book.js" line="13">

---

We define a PUT route to update an existing book by its ID. This route also requires admin authentication to ensure that only administrators can update book details.

```
router.put('/:id',auth.admin,BookCtrl.UpdateBook);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Handling DELETE requests

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Book.js" line="14">

---

We define a DELETE route to remove a book by its ID. This route requires admin authentication to ensure that only administrators can delete books.

```
router.delete('/:id',auth.admin,BookCtrl.DeleteBook);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

This setup ensures that book management operations are secure and properly authenticated.
