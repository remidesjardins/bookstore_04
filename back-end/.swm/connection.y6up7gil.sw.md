# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the connection feature.

The feature establishes a connection to a database using specific configuration parameters.

We will cover:

1. Why the database configuration is defined this way.
2. How the configuration is structured.
3. The importance of each configuration parameter.

# Database configuration

The database configuration is defined in <SwmPath>[database/connection.js](/database/connection.js)</SwmPath>. This configuration is crucial for establishing a connection to the database. The parameters include the host, port, user, password, and database name.

```
const dbConfig = {
    host: '192.168.1.51',
    port: 3306,
    user: 'root',
    password: '1234',
    database: 'Book'
};
```

Each parameter is essential:

- <SwmToken path="/database/connection.js" pos="2:1:1" line-data="    host: &#39;192.168.1.51&#39;,">`host`</SwmToken>: Specifies the IP address of the database server.
- <SwmToken path="/database/connection.js" pos="3:1:1" line-data="    port: 3306,">`port`</SwmToken>: Specifies the port number on which the database server is listening.
- <SwmToken path="/database/connection.js" pos="4:1:1" line-data="    user: &#39;root&#39;,">`user`</SwmToken>: The username for authenticating with the database.
- <SwmToken path="/database/connection.js" pos="5:1:1" line-data="    password: &#39;1234&#39;,">`password`</SwmToken>: The password for the specified user.
- <SwmToken path="/database/connection.js" pos="6:1:1" line-data="    database: &#39;Book&#39;">`database`</SwmToken>: The name of the database to connect to.

This setup ensures that the application can connect to the correct database with the necessary credentials.
