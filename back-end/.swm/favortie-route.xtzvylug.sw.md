title: Favortie Route
---
# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the "Favorite Route" feature.

The feature introduces a new set of routes for managing favorite items in the application.

We will cover:

1. Setting up the router.
2. Applying authentication middleware.
3. Defining the routes for CRUD operations.

# Setting up the router

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="6">

---

First, we initialize the router using Express. This is the starting point for defining our routes.

```
const router = express.Router();
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Applying authentication middleware

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="7">

---

We apply an authentication middleware to ensure that all routes under this router require authentication.

```
router.use(auth.Auth)
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Defining the routes for CRUD operations

We define various routes for handling CRUD operations on favorite items. Each route has specific authentication and authorization requirements.

## Get all favorites

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="9">

---

This route allows admin users to retrieve all favorite items.

```
router.get('/', auth.admin,FavoriteCtrl.GetAllFavorites);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Get one favorite

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="10">

---

This route allows authenticated users to retrieve a specific favorite item by its ID.

```
router.get('/:id', auth.user,FavoriteCtrl.GetOneFavorite);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Create a favorite

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="11">

---

This route allows authenticated users to create a new favorite item.

```
router.post('/',auth.user,FavoriteCtrl.CreateFavorite);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Update a favorite

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="12">

---

This route allows authenticated users to update an existing favorite item by its ID.

```
router.put('/:id', auth.user,FavoriteCtrl.UpdateFavorite);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Delete a favorite

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/Favorite.js" line="13">

---

This route allows authenticated users to delete a favorite item by its ID.

```
router.delete('/:id', auth.user,FavoriteCtrl.DeleteFavorite);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Conclusion

The "Favorite Route" feature sets up a new router with authentication and authorization to manage favorite items. Each route is protected and ensures that only authorized users can perform the respective operations.
