title: User route
---
# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the user route feature.

The feature introduces several endpoints for user management, including authentication and authorization checks.

We will cover:

1. Why we use middleware for authentication and authorization.
2. The design of CRUD operations for user management.
3. The specific routes and their purposes.

# Middleware for authentication and authorization

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="9">

---

We use middleware to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain routes. This is crucial for maintaining security and data integrity.

```
router.get('/', auth.Auth, auth.admin, UserCtrl.GetAllUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# CRUD operations for user management

We define routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users. Each route is associated with a specific controller function.

## Get all users

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="9">

---

This route fetches all users. It requires admin privileges.

```
router.get('/', auth.Auth, auth.admin, UserCtrl.GetAllUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Get one user

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="10">

---

This route fetches a single user by ID. It also requires admin privileges.

```
router.get('/:id', auth.Auth, auth.admin, UserCtrl.GetOneUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Create a user

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="11">

---

This route allows the creation of a new user. No authentication is required for this route.

```
router.post('/', UserCtrl.CreateUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Update a user

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="12">

---

This route updates user information based on the user ID. It requires the user to be authenticated.

```
router.put('/:id', auth.Auth, auth.user, UserCtrl.UpdateUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

## Delete a user

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="13">

---

This route deletes a user based on the user ID. It also requires the user to be authenticated.

```
router.delete('/:id', auth.Auth, auth.user, UserCtrl.DeleteUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# User login

<SwmSnippet path="/routes/User.js" line="14">

---

This route handles user login. It does not require prior authentication.

```
router.post('/login', UserCtrl.LoginUser);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# Conclusion

The user route feature introduces endpoints for managing users with appropriate authentication and authorization checks. This ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations, enhancing the security of the application.
